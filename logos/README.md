# Rboxlo Artwork
All artwork in this folder consist of edited Roblox game screenshots, and parodies of the official Roblox logos (past or present), created by the Roblox art team.

We do not want to upset any corporate fellows with this artwork; however, since we acknowledge that these are the official Roblox logos, and that these logos are simply parodies of them, we believe that our usage of the Roblox artwork fall under the Fair Use stature.
